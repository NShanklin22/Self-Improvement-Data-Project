This is my main personal project that I have been working on since summer 2021.

The primary function is to track my time spent in the 3 main categories of things that I want to learn:
1. Design (3D printing)
2. Programming (Python mostly but some core theory, pretty loose category)
3. Electronics (Arduino + workbook problems to refresh my physics)

There is an additional category of "gaming", used to track my gaming time.

For this project I created a command line menu structure with option to either enter data or pull data

The data can be pulled by current day, month (int 1-12), date range, and current week

After pulling data the user can create various matplotlib graphs with the data

As a result of working on this project I have greatly increased my programming study time and reduced the amount of time I play video games.
